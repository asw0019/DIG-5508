# I have had an interest in weather averages--especially monthly.
# Something about the differences in seasons, the ups and downs
# throughout the year. Maybe it's the contrast (I love the Winter 
# Summerland mini golf at Walt Disney World in large partfor this reason).

# The statistics section had me thinking about applications with
# which I am interested. Weather seemed like the most obvous, especially
# given current climate concerns.

# The program reads the a list of Strings from two different text documents,
# parses the strings into numbers (which they are obviously meant to be),
# stores them into two new arrays, and then takes those new arrays and finds
# the mean, median, and standard deviation of the arrays containing the highs
# and lows for the given period.

# I wish I had been able to figure out how to label various parts of a graph generated
# by Processing. However, given my current knowledge, I feel like I got the graph to do
# what I wanted.
