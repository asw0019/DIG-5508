#   I have modified the original program so that it tells of a greeting to one subject
#   will have some effect on a greeting or farewell of another subject, and the effect 
#   that it will have on another thing, ending with a final greeting. However, if 'hell'
#   is mentioned at all, the sentence stops and prints the next sentence. Similarly,
#   if the word 'damns' is printed for the verbs, it will reduce the counter. When
#   five "damns" are printed, the function stops.
