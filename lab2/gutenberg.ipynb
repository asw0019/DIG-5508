Had it been but one, it\nhad been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had\nbeen through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet\nMiss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived\nthrough centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the\nyears; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....\n\nOh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by\nthoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of\nfear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though\ntill all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen\nthe repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just\nere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been\nwon, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have\nendured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of\nwrithing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and\nleft my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them\nnow and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death\nfor a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife\nsevered the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and\ncrumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come\ncenturies agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud \"I\nam here!\"\n\nBefore I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can\nthe Count enter there Un-Dead.\n\nWhen I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her\nsleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.\n\n\"Come!\" she said, \"come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my\nhusband who is, I know, coming towards us.\" She was looking thin and\npale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was\nglad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the\nfresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.\n\nAnd so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet\nour friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are\ncoming to meet us.\n\n\n_Mina Harker's Journal._\n\n_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I\ntook our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did\nnot go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take\nheavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being\nleft without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our\nprovisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we\ncould see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of\nhabitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy\nwalking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the\nclear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under\nthe hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the\nCarpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,\nperched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with\nseemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain\non any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We\ncould hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the\nsound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was\nfull of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about\nthat he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less\nexposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we\ncould trace it through the drifted snow.\n\nIn a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined\nhim. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,\nwith an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the\nhand and drew me in: \"See!\" he said, \"here you will be in shelter; and\nif the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.\" He brought in our\nfurs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and\nforced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was\nrepulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could\nnot bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not\nreproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top\nof the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--\n\n\"Look! Madam Mina, look! look!\" I sprang up and stood beside him on the\nrock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling\nmore heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning\nto blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the\nsnow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we\nwere it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the\nwhite waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in\nkinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far\noff--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a\ngroup of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a\nlong leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail\nwagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the\nsnow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were\npeasants or gypsies of some kind.\n\nOn the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I\nfelt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and\nwell I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned\nthere, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all\npursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,\nhowever, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round\nthe rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last\nnight. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--\n\n\"At least you shall be safe here from _him_!\" He took the glasses from\nme, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.\n\"See,\" he said, \"they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and\ngalloping as hard as they can.\" He paused and went on in a hollow\nvoice:--\n\n\"They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be\ndone!\" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole\nlandscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his\nglasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--\n\n\"Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the\nsouth. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow\nblots it all out!\" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward\nand Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.\nAt the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around\nI saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at\nbreak-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,\nof course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with\nthe cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,\nand, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he\nlaid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the\nopening of our shelter. \"They are all converging,\" he said. \"When the\ntime comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.\" I got out my revolver\nready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came\nlouder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.\nIt was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,\nand beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down\ntowards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could\nsee here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger\nnumbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.\n\nEvery instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in\nfierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in\ncircling eddies. At times we could not see an arm's length before us;\nbut at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to\nclear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of\nlate been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew\nwith fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the\nsun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less\nthan an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various\nbodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer\nand more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly\nhad driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,\nthe snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each\nparty, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did\nnot seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they\nseemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower\nand lower on the mountain tops.\n\nCloser and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind\nour rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined\nthat they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our\npresence.\n\nAll at once two voices shouted out to: \"Halt!\" One was my Jonathan's,\nraised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolute\ntone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but\nthere was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were\nspoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming\nand Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the\nother. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his\nhorse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his\ncompanions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang\nforward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an\nunmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van\nHelsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.\nSeeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew\nup. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the\ngypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held\nhimself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.\n\nThe leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in\nfront, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill\ntops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.\nFor answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses\nand dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing\nJonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been\nupon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,\nsurging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our\nparties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly\nformed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one\nshouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the\norder.\n\nIn the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring\nof men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was\nevident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun\nshould set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the\nlevelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor\nthe howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their\nattention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his\npurpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they\ncowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the\ncart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great\nbox, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.\nMorris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of\nSzgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,\nwith the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had\nseen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and\nthey cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first\nI thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang\nbeside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that\nwith his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was\nspurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for\nas Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,\nattempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked\nthe other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the\nlid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and\nthe top of the box was thrown back.\n\nBy this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,\nand at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made\nno resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the\nshadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count\nlying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from\nthe cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen\nimage, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I\nknew too well.\n\nAs I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them\nturned to triumph.\n\nBut, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.\nI shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same\nmoment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.\n\nIt was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the\ndrawing of a breath, the whole body crumble into dust and passed from\nour sight.\n\nI shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final\ndissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never\ncould have imagined might have rested there.\n\nThe Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone\nof its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the\nsetting sun.\n\nThe gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary\ndisappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as\nif for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the\nleiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,\nwhich had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving\nus alone.\n\nMr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his\nhand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I\nflew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the\ntwo doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his\nhead on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand\nin that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of\nmy heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--\n\n\"I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!\" he cried\nsuddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, \"It was\nworth for this to die! Look! look!\"\n\nThe sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams\nfell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse\nthe men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest \"Amen\" broke from all\nas their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man\nspoke:--\n\n\"Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not\nmore stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!\"\n\nAnd, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a\ngallant gentleman.\n\n\n\n\n                                  NOTE\n\n\nSeven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of\nsome of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It\nis an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy's birthday is the same\nday as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the\nsecret belief that some of our brave friend's spirit has passed into\nhim. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but\nwe call him Quincey.\n\nIn the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went\nover the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and\nterrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things\nwhich we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were\nliving truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The\ncastle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.\n\nWhen we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all\nlook back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily\nmarried. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since\nour return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the\nmass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one\nauthentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later\nnote-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing's memorandum.\nWe could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as\nproofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with\nour boy on his knee:--\n\n\"We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day\nknow what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her\nsweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so\nloved her, that they did dare much for her sake.\"\n\nJONATHAN HARKER.\n\n                                THE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                       _There's More to Follow!_\n\n     More stories of the sort you like; more, probably, by the author of\n     this one; more than 500 titles all told by writers of world-wide\n     reputation, in the Authors' Alphabetical List which you will find\n     on the _reverse side_ of the wrapper of this book.
